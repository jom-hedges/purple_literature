<strong>Carl Watts</strong> - When I read your poetry, I’m struck by how easily you combine the disjunctive characteristics of the Language tradition with grammatical sentences that, without line breaks, could be prose. How would you describe your poetics?


<strong>Rivka Clifton</strong> - when I was in undergrad, I read some critic of Greek lyric poetry (athaneus maybe?) And his whole deal was that if you delined poems they would sound like prose and gave examples from sappho--it's why we even have most of her poetry today because when the early church was burning queer literature they forgot to check critical texts.


I guess my poetics is I try to write something true and use lines to make these truths more true or to get me to see their actual untruth. Kind of pretentious thing to say I guess. But I think sentences have all these little nuggets in them that can be teased apart or clustered to prompt thought. 


Or idk I kind of just write what I want to read or in a way that makes me feel terrified. 


<strong>CW</strong> - What is going on with the asterisks in your poems? 


<strong>RC</strong> - when I was an egg, I was writing all these poems about a transfemme person who was essentially me. She was navigating the expansiveness of gender, which I am finding more and more as I medically transition. She was also navigating cancer--i started writing the asterisk poems while both my parents were going through cancer treatments. I started thinking about cancer as a multiplication of cells,.a too muchness. I wanted poems to try to fit in their boxes/sections but end up overflowing--like cancerous cells, like the performance of gender for many trans people. So I tried these little sections that were rarely end stopped to keep that in my brain.


Also there are so many asterisks for queer people: trans*, lgbtq*, asterisks on hrt, asterisks in our medical charts, asterisks that cover our info as we doll out copays, etc etc. 


<strong>CW</strong> - Your more recent poems that I’ve read address experiences as a trans person. How would you describe the way your poetry engages with personal issues? Would you ever dare to use the term “confessional poet”? 


<strong>RC</strong> - kate nuernberger once said she's a confessional poet who likes to lie. I resonate with that. I think I've always written about my experiences but once I've started living more openly as myself and being more honest with myself I saw that reflected more in my writing. 


I think when haela Ravenna hunt Hendrix of liturgy came out she said something like her male mask distorted the transmission of her music. That also resonated with me. In muzzle, my book that's coming out, I have all these husband/wife poems. When I shared them with my friend Ashley roach-frieman (who is a phenomenal poet), she said the wife poems felt more alive and more real. I feel like now I understand why.


Also transitioning takes up a lot of my life. Administering hormones, doing electrolysis, surgeries, blood tests, learning how to apply makeup, rebuilding my closet, screaming into the void, being chased and harassed by men, lamenting my past, lamenting my present, hoping for a future, being in community with other trans people, supporting young queers--it becomes literally all one does. I'm a full time transgirl, so it makes sense it would pour into my poems.


All said, confessional, as a term, feels problematic in a literary world that basically requires writers of any marginalized identity (queers, trans people, writers of color, women, disabled writers etc etc) to write about their experiences as those identities. Like we don't get the choice, we have to be confessional so presses and magazines can point to our work and say "look, we did a DEI! Inclusion!" Everyone go read "why I don't write the body" by Gordon Hall. 


<strong>CW</strong> - We recently met in person for the first time, at AWP. Before that, I’d seen you present remotely, at the Chinese/American Association for Poetry and Poetics Conference. How would you describe your relationship with institutions, and how has that affected your poetics?


<strong>RC</strong> - I don't have a relationship with institutions. That was made clear in my PhD program--ask me in person; I love to gossip. It also becomes clearer to me every day that to be a good person you cannot engage with institutions--see poem a day, small press distribution, mla job list. Until institutions start actively working towards the safety and care of all marginalized people, I'm leaving them on read.


<strong>CW</strong> - Is there, in your mind, any definable relationship between music and poetry? Lyrics and poetry of course might seem the most interconnected, but I’m interested as well in whether non-verbal sonic qualities might also have some relationship with poetry. 


<strong>RC</strong> - I think repetition and variation is another connection. But maybe any similarity between the two art forms is via metaphor or like something fascinating in any types of art. 


<strong>CW</strong> - From what I understand, you have pretty diverse tastes in music. Would you consider what you listen to as pop? Or do you enjoy things that could be described as avant-garde, classical, etc.? 


<strong>RC</strong> - I try to stay eclectic. It's fun to go from Mariah Carey to wolves in the throne room. My current favorites are: feminizer, vouna, fever ray, anna von hauswolff, Connie diiamond, bbymutha, ssion, forhist, and midwife.
