<strong>Jonathan Miller:</strong> There’s an element of goofiness in your poetry. What’s the role of the comic in poetry, if any at all?

<strong>Matthew Schmidt:</strong> Poetry can capture anything—it doesn’t have to be stoic all the time. Considering the importance of rhyme in poetry, how can it eschew the comic? Children’s rhymes, songs, fairy tales, are steeped in rhyme—it’s the first type of storytelling an average human encounters. Rhyme makes it not only memorable, but fun. Moreover, the world is goofy. You can’t tell me using paper to stand for wealth isn’t ridiculous. Also, look at how long it took for human life to evolve on earth. It’s so amazing, the flukes of life. And, how could I not mention imagination. Why wasn’t my consciousness in a dinosaur, a beetle, a daffodil… come to think of it, what is consciousness? Oh right, we made up that word to stand for an idea.  

<strong>JM: </strong>After reading your poem "Little Hair", I was wondering if there was one type of animal hair to sprout from a tattoo, then what animal would you choose? Going a little larger, if you had to swap your head of hair for any animal's fur, what animal would you choose and why?

<strong>MS: </strong>If I stuck with reptiles, it’d have to be an iguana for two reasons: 1) The spikes on their backs look like hair—a mohawk of sorts (but just a single one of those would look insane) and 2) they have dewlaps. I mean, good lord, dewlaps are strange. I love when anoles bob up and down with their dewlaps out. Also, hair is highly related to amorous activity, at least in how people consider mates and what they are after, so the dewlap is a close relative to hair. For non-reptiles the obvious answer is the porcupine since the hair could be weaponized, thus having an obvious use. Think of all the people who touch you that you’d rather just keep to themselves.  I’m not sure single back hairs have a lot of use—one would have to have a lot of back hairs to keep warm I suppose, but even then, clothes are available, meaning maybe back hair isn’t as necessary as it used to be in human evolution. For the non-obvious answer I’m going to go with the Sphynx cat—I don’t really want hair sprouting from my tattoos. 

I dig this question: if I had to swap hair with another animal, I don’t know if I could pick just one. Look at all the cool colors and styles out there. I do like a number of primates: some baboons have amazing faces (and rumps), howler monkeys are cool, but then you have African wild dogs, peacocks, an astonishing number of frogs sporting a wide range of the color palate, wolves, cats…I could go on and on. A smart fellow would pick a chameleon and have it any way he wanted. If I had to pin one down (and had to choose one with hair), I’d go with the silver fox. Not the archetype, but one of the strange melanin coated ones…like this:

<strong>JM:</strong> How has your poetry changed over time?

<strong>MS:</strong> The early poems are awful. Once in a while I’ll come across something I haven’t thrown away and cringe. The earliest writing took itself so seriously, as if it was important. It’s gone through phases of questioning, documenting, spoofing, imitating. For a time I wrote with only sound directing the poem—not end rhyme, just internally. To get an idea, listen to some MF Doom. There was an experimental year or two, although no one can agree on what that means. What I tried to do, without really thinking about it, was explore the parameters of what poetry can be, do. That never really ends, though my poems now seem both more contained and expansive. I’m not sure that I like that. Inevitably, it will change.

<strong>JM: </strong> What has been the biggest impediment to your writing?

<strong>MS:</strong> Thinking that I have to write a certain way for my writing to be worthwhile. It’s hard if your writing isn’t popular or praised. Sadly, ego and business and living get in the way of writing. For a long time I felt like my writing wasn’t getting a fair shake by the powers that be in the poetry community. It feels foolish now. I’ve come to realize that if my writing is enjoyed by the few editors, friends, and unknown readers out there, that is more than enough. I never set out to write to be famous, but because it made me feel good mentally, emotionally, physically. Unfortunately, I got caught up in the hype and pomp of the idea of great writers as being more than ordinary people. But, society teaches us we should do this, want that. It seems the older I get, the less I care about  
contests, comparisons, positions. Still, as much as I want to let go of everything, it remains worrisome that I don’t feel like I fit in anywhere particular. Ego and self-esteem and other brain functions are what have always impeded me most.  

<strong>JM:</strong> How do your poems develop? Can you guide readers through one of your poems?

<strong>MS:</strong> My best poems begin with a line or an image and feeling takes over. Words tumble out and somehow the pieces fit pretty well. Of course, very few poems are done after a single draft. I find that letting them languish for a couple years is good. My mindset has changed, life has continued, new things have happened. If I can come back to a poem after all that time and it still speaks to me, then I’ll revise it. Sometimes, I’ll revise and let it sit for some more time. Sometimes I’ll keep tinkering with it regularly. It really depends on what grips my mind, my attention.  

“Holy War is Harder Than it Looks” began long after the original event that sparked the idea. Walking across the University of Arizona campus I passed a young man handing out pocket bibles. I took one to appease him, to stop the conversation. A couple months later I passed another young man. He wasn’t handing out bibles, but wanted to talk to me about Christianity. Because I was in a more jovial mood, I asked him to walk with me, we could chat on my way to class. I asked questions to poke holes in his belief; undeterred he referred to overarching tenets that supposedly overruled whatever beef I had with a particular part of the bible or organized religion. His earnestness was real, still I couldn’t help but wonder what he would think once his brain was fully formed. Anyway, I didn’t write that poem until years later. Those interactions stayed with me. Instead of simply documenting them, I conflated multiple events of experience with fiction. I’ve never had a wife, but religion (and culture) expects me to. So, one of the things that happened is I took the POV of a husband in a rural setting, imagined what might happen. None of this was planned and I don’t really know what “shadow-bushes” are, it just feels right. The carnage at the end was a surprise as well, but it fits in fairly well with religiousness in general. Much violence has been committed in its name. It went through several phases of revision, years on the shelf, until I felt it was strong enough to work as a poem. In revising, I tried to get closer to the ideas and images that stood out from the first draft. To work toward its essences. To say the thing, and more.  

<strong>JM:</strong> As children, there might be a book on the shelf that draws a child's attention. What was that book for you as a child?

<strong>MS:</strong> My mother read me <i>Goodnight, Moon</i> so often we had to repair the book several times. The other one was an illustrated version of Aesop's Fables. How could I not write about animals in a quirky manner?

<strong>JM: </strong> What about televsision shows or movies that you had recorded on VHS? Could you describe any of those VHS mashups as a prose poem?

<strong>MS: </strong> Up and out the hole, slow, slow. Proboscis first for the scents and sense. Who’s there swishing through the underbrush? David the Gnome trundles past and our home rumbles  like an owl turned inside out. Gotta watch taloners. Gotta keep hidden from naked bears with loud limbs. Wheeze and crack. Please and not thanked. Sometimes a viscous sky stems the hunt and sight becomes the only weapon. The wind is up and my fur stands like a second sun against tree bark. I have to burn prey quickly or burn hungry. My kits nip and tear. My den groans and groans and…a sewer good as any place to dilute. Hang a door to make it human. Radical, gnarly. Ooze a slick growth. A head band to distinguish. A rat to lead. We are never born to a whole shell. Master weapons, footwork, quips. It’s enough to fight as one even if to win is not to succeed…for a place to safely know. Half the battle is. Specialized skills versus snakes. Cobraic uniformity. Mask without a mouth slot. Metal face. These, our accoutrement gauze.

<strong>JM: </strong>When was the moment you decided that you wanted to write poetry?

<strong>MS: </strong>Summer of 2012. I wrote poetry on and off for years before that, but it was never more than a hobby prior to 2012. That summer I visited a friend in Austin and ended up staying on their couch for several months, quitting my desk job (which I hated) in the process. I realized I didn’t want to be another keyboard jockey for a business that I didn’t believe in. I also wanted to do something that felt meaningful. Poetry/writing was the only thing I really loved at the time so I began a more earnest study of the craft, including writing regularly.

<strong>JM: </strong>In your poem “The City”, readers can see the key to the city changing hands multiple times throughout. Then the speaker states, “Nobody knew anyone’s name. The father of the key forgot his duties and the gatekeeper slumbered.” How can poetry help establish social accountability?

<strong>MS: </strong>Poetry can be storytelling. It can be nonfiction. My favorite thing about it though is that it is often an amalgamation of fictive and nonfictive elements. As a genre it can contain most anything. Writing is a way of thinking through experiences, including social interactions, laws, work, etc. Whether the writing is fantastical or not, it can still ask questions or posit situations that speak to communal existence. Of course, what one person writes another may read—an attempt at communication is always a societal act.  

<strong>JM: </strong>The science teacher has detonated a bomb, then in subsequent sections and poems, thinking of  “Matter to Make the Blue Matter” the line lengths get disrupted with white space, and the language almost takes on a meta-conceptual type abstraction layer. How would you explain the language shifts in an Intro to Poetry class?

<strong>MS: </strong>Look at what you can do with words! Seriously, though, the way words are arranged and ordered can express emotional resonances. The science teacher appears in a numbered prose poem. “The City” contains language that is more technical, more scholarly, than “Matter to Make the Blue Matter.” The idea is that the city is an orderly place that follows agreed upon rules and regulations. The poem, then, follows a more rigorous form: sentences, sections, logic. “Matter to Make the Blue Matter” is more interested in creating emotion through memory. As has been cataloged by science, memory is not a reliable tool. Formally, the poem follows suit, cataloging snippets of memory from the speaker’s mind. In this way the poem/speaker tries to make meaning of what has happened (or is thought to have happened) in their life. This is how form is important and can be utilized within your own writing.
