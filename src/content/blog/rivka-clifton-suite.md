<h2>The Catalogue of Ships</h2>
</br>

The first time I graced a boy's  
cheek, he followed me  

around the playground singing  
*you are so stupid, so incredibly stupid.*  

There was no malice in it--  
my fist undid itself mid-swing.  

The first time I was graced  
by a boy, we were at the park  

the high school kids called  
a playground. We were stupid  

off double-fisting plastic chalices  
of something. I was a boy  

then. The first time malice  
undid me I was talking about grace  

to a lapsed Catholic. *So*  
*stupid*, I said and followed  

it with nothing. The first undoing  
followed a state of grace.  

In the story, I fit a whole fist in  
my mouth. I let him stroke  

it wet across my face. My friends  
were parked on a couch  

in the other room. Then I came  
to in the park mid-swig.  

This was not the first time  
I lied. I was a boy in a car  

with another boy, high  
school kids. He called to me first  

and then I called to him.  
I stupidly followed  

looking for grace. I wish  
I could say my friends  

were malicious, but they were  
not--too busy lapping up  

what was left in plastic cups,  
too busy believing in Catholicism  

to practice Catholicism.  
The first time I was followed  

home, I was no longer a boy.  
A man stood outside  

my room telling me how  
my stupid soul glowed orange  

like a pumpkin. *How could  
anyone love it?* he asked. He wanted  

to love it. He said he wanted  
to turn my body into a playground  

for his. He sang about grace--  
so odd because neither of us  

believed in grace, not really.

<h2>Imagining a Thing that does not Look like a Ghost</h2>

The filmstrip folded through the projector; shot across the room--  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;the image: a nail impaling a foot over a pitcher of milk.  

Tilted as if into a mouth. One nested inside the other: the city and the suburb,
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; the house and the room, the brain  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and the long trenches a claw hammer dug into the plaster.

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The house's dark muscles shifted. A storm massaged the house into place--  
its music when bowed just right. The crescendo of touch. Of pleasure turned into pleasure  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; with pain and then to pain. I popped a knuckle, a vertebra and  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; exhaled.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The house's upturned face, swelled, the overture of demolition. All the strings  
hummed  

their own unraveling. A thousand voices sang. The phrases rung as if through a chain.  

It, too, was a pleasure to score the house with a soundtrack meant for another place.  
I thought how similar the sounds score and scour and the action, too.  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The conductor's wrist, the hand rubbing a spot,  
the knife through dough, eye tracing and retracing -- they all dig in,  

weigh on the brain like an oversized locket dangling from a chain. A deadweight--  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; as in the dead waited inside  

Across the wall, the image of a mirror reflected the camera without an operator. Dead  
center, the white dot of the mirror within  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;the camera stared at the eye scouring the eye within the mirror. In my brain,  

a dying pulses its distress signal. I turned the projector and like a chemical dust blown  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;across the landscape it lit the backyard. Its milky sliver  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; flowed down the window's single tooth. Within my brain, the two superimposed.  
What was there? Projector and filmstrip. The eye inside the ruptured eye.

<h2>To Ask</h2>

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; I stopped thinking  
about the hate crimes that happened  

streets away from my apartment. Everyday  

a softening, a routine. I scrolled through  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; calendars. I put pills under  
my tongue and waited for them to dissolve.  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; I lay  
on a table and focused  
on my breathing  

as one person then another inserted a thin  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; electric needle  

\*  

into my face, my neck, my chest, my junk--  

what a word -- there were nights  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I would beg  
for touch. And touch would come  

\*  

as a needle, a vapor--anything sucked  
in and held. Now each prick I take  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;is a shedding--the desire I had  

to pass to strangers or be nothing.  
In a labyrinth, everyone seeks  
a hollow space. Once I believed  

my body were an easy labyrinth--  
one straight line from throat to end.

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; That is how  
the world was. That was how  
I thought the world was.  

\*  

Days of passing and days of not.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The desire to change  

or to savor a moment in my body's twisting.  

No one thinks about a labyrinth's  
entrance, the opening that leads to  

\*  

nowhere. They think  
only of the center  
where one or two  

conclude. The body, a labyrinth, yes,  
the clothes, too, a labyrinth, the aisles  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; of a Goodwill--a labyrinth,   
where I replace one wardrobe for another.  
Once, in this, my favorite labyrinth,  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;a man came to me. I did not beg  

\*  

for him to appear. My junk was sore  
from being pin cushion and conductor.  

The man came close, unabomber chic,  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to ask if I had a cock.
