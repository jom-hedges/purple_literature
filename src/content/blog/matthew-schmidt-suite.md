<h2>Little Hair</h2>

In the suburbs no one talks about hair.  

Hairs appear as if one pore is sick  
of looking in. It sprouts thin, grows, curls.

One day, looking in the mirror  
in the blasted suburbs, I see the wisp.

It's cloaked in my tattoo,  
hunkers in the ink, a giant reptile neck.  

The wonder of living in the suburbs is that you live  
on top of and between people.  
Vacuum cleaners and fights break out.  

Watching pornography is done with the volume  
low and when you get a waif hair on your back,  
in an impossible spot to pluck yourself, you knock  

next door. This is where the suburbs are not so great.  
Soon everyone is talking about hair. Soon the shades  
can't be opened and you're living in a shameful box.  

When the hair-fiasco finally blows over, I come out  
like a clock bird: annoying and a little coo-coo. My back  
smooth and covered in wax burns and cocoa butter.

<h2>Holy War is Harder Than it Looks</h2>

I paused under a streetlight,  
its circular spot dousing the curb  
in what could be called safety,  
but that shows we have something to fear.  
And the little book they peddled  
wouldn't fit my pocket  
without bulging,  
so I threw it to the neighbor's yard,  
expecting them to appreciate  
good news when they found it.  
Later that week, stained-grass  
pages appeared in my yard  
and I quibbled with my wife  
whether it was litter or law.  
Without vision, she said no one  
would love their neighbor.  
<i>What about the shadow-bushes</i>  
<i>we don gloves to prune, worried</i>  
<i>beetles might alight our fingers,</i>  
<i>spindly appendages and husky</i>  
<i>shells?</i> There is nothing  
The Good Book condemns  
more than trespass -- to our  
great horror a woodpecker  
knocked a beetle senseless  
against a branch outside  
our window. I'd just  
shined it up and the light was  
perfect to view the carnage.

<h2>The City</h2>

<strong>1.</strong>
</br>
One hundred yards explode.  

An argument to own a discussion on the properties of property: a science teacher fiddles with a bomb. No, that already happened. Analysis: short tongues hang from tree limbs.

An entire faculty digests the fall of night. Students interested in where the school day has gone dredge bones of stars in twilight.

This demonstration of explosion, free thinking, feral bodies swallowed by the weight of learning turns outside the perimeter of fatality. For, inside the cordon is barren earth, one hundred lawns in flame and only the dogs have escaped.

<strong>2.</strong>
</br>
Is microscopic.

A cleft of signifiers and prints. Tell us when to recalibrate our eyes.

It's quiet topography we inhibit. Is this a getting together or separating? Tree houses next, as we climb, for the land is full.

Careful throat clearing impolite. Metro infers polis. Horizon shifts as rooftops form.

Look, settlement is a subtle trick.

Adjustment of <i>I</i> so as to <i>territorialize</i>. Microscope our palms to determine proprietary lines to shake and try to mean.

<strong>3.</strong>
</br>
Because a tantrum was thrown by the key to the city father. He did not make copies.

Each light blew out on the street, car horns intersected, corroded metal and burnt flesh.

The key to the city was transferred each year and one person became the gatekeeper. Rules were established anew.

Elms bent under scrawny squirrels. There was little water; the rain did not always know the password.

In the houses people couldn't open cupboards. The key to the city locked every door.

Cameras were outlawed. The picturesque view of the river became a murky bed. The bed of people lying. The lies accumulating to soften the first lie.

Nobody knew anyone's name. The father of the key forgot his duties and the gatekeeper slumbered.

Opening is the nectar I'd like to trust.

The city taking tongues.
